Description: This web app and open source 
        software package for the R 
        programming language was built to facilitate exploration of the 
        naturally occurring sequence diversity for your favorite gene or 
        gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana. We hope this web app will 
        help plant biologists without bioinformatics experience access 
        the 1001 genomes project’s rich catalog of natural variation and 
        formulate hypotheses and identify new alleles in their favorite 
        gene family.
